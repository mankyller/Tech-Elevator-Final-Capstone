        <h1> Terms of Service </h1>
        <p>This terms of use policy is effective from June 13, 2024.</p>
        <br>

        <div class="subject-title"> 1. Limitations</div>
        <p> In no event shall Sheltered Furry Friends be liable for any damages 
            (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data
            or profit, damages as a result of an app, platform, or 
            website this shop uses to maintain normal business procedures, 
            or due to business or personal interruption) arising out 
            of the use or inability to use the materials on the shop's 
            website, even if the shop or an authorized agent of this 
            shop has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility 
            of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow 
            limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability 
            for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may 
            not apply to you. 
        </p>
        <br>

        <div class="subject-title"> 2. Revisions and Errata </div>
        <p> The materials appearing on the shop's website or within
            products may include technical, typographical, or photographic
            errors. The shop does not warrant that any of the materials 
            on its website or in products are accurate, complete, or current. 
            The shop may make changes to the materials contained on its 
            website or within products at any time without notice. The shop 
            does not, however, make any commitment to update the materials. 
        </p>
        <br>

        <div class="subject-title"> 3. Links </div>
        <p> The shop has not reviewed all of the sites linked to its website 
            and is not responsible for the contents of any such linked site. 
            The inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement by the shop 
            of the site or its products. Use of any such linked website is 
            at the user's own risk. 
        </p>
        <br>

        <div class="subject-title"> 4. Site Terms of Use Modifications</div>
        <p> The shop may revise these Terms of Use for its shop or website 
            at any time without notice. By using this website you are 
            agreeing to be bound by the then current version of these 
            Terms of Use.
        </p>

            its affiliated companies, and its respective employees, officers,

            all losses, claims, suits, actions, liabilities, obligations, costs,

            relating to or arising out of (i) a breach of customer's obligations 
            under this agreement, (ii) customer's violation of any applicable laws, 
            rules or regulations; (iii) customer's failure to comply with any 
            applicable privacy law, (iv) customer's participation in the shop;

        <br>

        <div class="subject-title"> 6. Severability </div>
        <p> If any of the provisions of this agreement is or becomes illegal, 
            unenforceable or invalid (in whole or in part for any reason),
